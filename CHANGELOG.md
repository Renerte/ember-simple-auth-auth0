## Say Hello to ember-auto-import!

## v3.0.1 (March 12th, 2017)

## Added Deprecations

- By default this addon would pass in the following block into the auth0 lock constructor. However, in 4.0.0 it will no longer do this, you will have to pass in the options yourself.

The default options were as follows:

```js
let defaultOptions = {
  autoclose: true,
  auth: {
    redirect: false,
    params: {
      scope: 'openid'
    },
  }
};
```

Now you will have to pass them in manually if you want the same behavior:

```js
let lockOptions = {
  autoclose: true,
  auth: {
    redirect: false,
    params: {
      scope: 'openid'
    },
  }
};

get(this, 'session').authenticate('authenticator:auth0-lock', lockOptions);
```
### Pull Requests

- [#66](https://github.com/seawatts/ember-simple-auth-auth0/pull/66) **chore**: Add deprecations *by [Chris Watts](https://github.com/seawatts)*

## v3.0.0 (February 25th, 2017)

## Breaking Changes

- The addon no longer navigates to the auth0 logout url when the session is invalidated through ember-simple-auth session. You have to manually call session.navigateToLogoutURL()
- Use idToken instead of jwt on the authenticated object when making requests to the backend.
- Use idTokenPayload.exp instead of exp to figure out when the token is about to expire
- USe logoutReturnToURL instead of logoutURL in the environment config. This will be used when calling navigateToLogoutURL()
- Remove redirectURI from the environment config.
